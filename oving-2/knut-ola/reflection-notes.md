## First meetup

At the start of this exercise, I introduced my group members to VSCode, the Arduino extension and GIT as described in this projects README. Most were unfamiliar with this.
The purpose was to centralize our code, as well as teaching them proper coding practices and introducing the wonders of an actual IDE, compared to ArduinoIDE which provides minimal help in the coding and debugging department. This worked excellently, and everyone immediately understood the impact of using proper tools when programming.

## Notes for the project

As this was an individual exercise, we choose not to sign any contracts regarding contributions, nor properly plan our physical meetups or deadlines. For the project the whole group seems to agree we should acquire a formal proof of contribution. An idea I pitched that was well received was to use GitHub for all code submissions, as well as ensuring the person who created something should always be the one to commit and merge their own code. That way we have clear, unalterable documentation of our own work, something that can be used in the event of any potential conflict. As a safety policy the master branch of our repository requires a pull-request to be merged, and cannot be pushed to directly. As a bonus, everyone will have a version of the repository on their computer, effectively giving us a robust backup of the project.
